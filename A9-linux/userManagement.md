How to change another user's password in Linux
To change a password for another user in Linux, you need to be logged in as a root user. Here's how you can do it:

Open the Terminal window.

Type the su - or sudo -i command and tap Enter.

Now as a root user, type the passwd command followed by a username for which you wish to prompt a password change: passwd username

Now enter the new password for the user and confirm it by retyping to it once more.

Tap Enter and you're all done!
